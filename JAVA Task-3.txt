1)Create a class named "Person" with attributes "name" and "age". Also create  a constructor nd getter methods for the attributes.

Program:

public class Person {
String name;  //data members
int age;
public Person(String name, int age) {  //constructor
 this.name = name;
 this.age = age;
 }
public String getName() { //getter method
return name;
}
public int getAge() {
return age;
}
}

Main Class:

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Person p1 = new Person("Laddu", 01);
Person p2 = new Person("Tinkle", 02);
System.out.println(p1.getName() + " is " + p1.getAge() + " years old.");
System.out.println(p2.getName() + " is " + p2.getAge() + " years old.");
}
}

Output:

Laddu is 1 years old.
Tinkle is 2 years old.


2)Create an implementation for a java class named employee that represents an employee with attributes including ID, name and salary. The class includes a method called raiseSalary(percent), which updates the salary by a specified Percentage.

public class Employee{
int id;
String firstname;
String lastname;
int salary;
public Employee(int id, String firstname, String lastname, int salary){
  this.id=id;
  this.firstname=firstname;
  this.lastname=lastname;
  this.salary=salary;
}
public void raisesalary(int percentage){
salary=salary+(salary*(percentage/100));
}
}

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
System.out.print("Enter the firstname:");  
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in); 
String firstname=sc.nextLine();
System.out.print("Enter the Lastname:");
String lastname=sc.nextLine();
System.out.print("Enter the salary:");
int salary=sc.nextInt();
System.out.print("Enter the employee ID:");
int id=sc.nextInt();
Employee obj=new Employee(id, firstname, lastname, salary);
System.out.print("Enter the percentage to raise salary:");
int percentage=sc.nextInt();
obj.raisesalary(percentage);
System.out.println("Employee"+ " " + id +" "+ firstname +" "+ lastname +" "+ salary);
}
}

OUtput:
Enter the firstname: laddu
Enter the Lastname: mk
Enter the salary: 60000
Enter the employee ID: 2
Enter the percentage to raise salary: 5
Employee 2 laddu mk 60000
 


3) Create a circle clas with radius as data member. Create two constructor (no arguments and two arguments) and a method  to circle circumference.

public class Circle{
double radius;
double pivalue=3.14;
public Circle( ) {  //0 argument constructor

 }
public Circle (double radius, double pivalue) { //2-argument constructor
this.radius=radius;
this.pivalue=pivalue;
}
public double getCircumference()   //getter method for getting the circumference
{
  return (2*pivalue*radius);
}
}

Main:

public class Main{
public static void main(String args[]){
Circle c=new Circle(2.25, 3.14);
double circumference=c.getCircumference();  //method is called here
System.out.println("circumferece of a circle is " + circumference);
}
}

Output:

circumferece of a circle is 14.13
4) Create a Tea class in Java that includes the following methods:
a) prepare Tea()- a method that prepares a basic tea with hot water and tea leaves
b)addMilk()-a method that adds milk to the basic tea.
c)addSugar()-a method that adds sugar to the basic tea.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Tea{

//0 argument constructor- not necessary
public Tea(){

}

//Methods
public void prepareTea()
{
System.out.println("Basic tea has been prepared with Hotwater and tea leaves");
}
public void addmilk()
{

System.out.println("Milk has been added to the Basic Tea");
}
public void addsugar()
{

System.out.println("Sugar has been added to the Basic Tea");
}
}



public class Main{
public static void main(String args[]){
Tea teaobj=new Tea();
teaobj.prepareTea();  //using object to call the methods
teaobj.addmilk();
teaobj.addsugar();
}
}

Output:
Basic tea has been prepared with Hotwater and tea leaves
Milk has been added to the Basic Tea
Sugar has been added to the Basic Tea


5)Create Three subclass of the Tea class: Black Tea Green Tea and Herbal Tea. Each subclass shoud override the PrepareTea()method to prepare the specific type of tea (black tea, green tea, or herbal tea) with appropriate ingredients and brewing time

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Tea{
public Tea(){

}
public void prepareTea()
{
System.out.println("Basic tea has been prepared with Hotwater and tea leaves");
}

class blackTea extends Tea{
  @Override
  public void prepareTea(){
    System.out.println("Blacktea is prepared with black tea leaves and water, for a brewing time of 3-5 minutes");
  }
}

class herbalTea extends Tea{
  @Override
  public void prepareTea(){
    System.out.println("Herbaltea is prepared with herb tea leaves and water, for a brewing time of 5-7 minutes");
  }
}

class greenTea extends Tea{
  @Override
  public void prepareTea(){
    System.out.println("Greentea is prepared with green tea leaves and water at 175 degree F, for a brewing time of 1-3 minutes");
  }
}


public class Main{
public static void main(String args[]){
Tea teaobj=new Tea();
blackTea bobj=new blackTea();
herbalTea hobj=new herbalTea();
greenTea gobj=new greenTea();
teaobj.prepareTea();
bobj.prepareTea();
hobj.prepareTea();
gobj.prepareTea();
}
}

Output:

Basic tea has been prepared with Hotwater and tea leaves
Blacktea is prepared with black tea leaves and water, for a brewing time of 3-5 minutes
Herbaltea is prepared with herb tea leaves and water, for a brewing time of 5-7 minutes
Greentea is prepared with green tea leaves and water at 175 degree F, for a brewing time of 1-3 minutes

7)Implement polymorphism in your program by creating an array of Tea bjects that include instances of the tea class and its subclass.

public class Main{
public static void main(String args[]){
Tea[] teaArray=new Tea[4];
teaArray[0]=new Tea();
teaArray[1]=new blackTea();
teaArray[2]=new herbalTea();
teaArray[3]=new greenTea();
for (Tea tea:teaArray){
  tea.prepareTea();
}
}
}
Basic tea has been prepared with Hotwater and tea leaves
Blacktea is prepared with black tea leaves and water, for a brewing time of 3-5 minutes
Herbaltea is prepared with herb tea leaves and water, for a brewing time of 5-7 minutes
Greentea is prepared with green tea leaves and water at 175 degree F, for a brewing time of 1-3 minutes
